# 🚀 About Me

I am a final-year student at BITS Pilani focused on building intelligent systems and scalable backend architectures. 

My work spans distributed systems, backend engineering, and AI/ML pipelines. I enjoy building end-to-end systems — from core algorithms and ML models to production-grade infrastructure that serves them reliably at scale.

* 🔬 Built self-improving LLM pipelines using Reinforcement Learning (Dual-PPO)
* ⚙️ Developed backend systems using Go, PostgreSQL & REST APIs
* 📊 Designed ML systems for Deepfake Detection and intelligent ranking
* 📱 Built production mobile & full-stack applications used by real users

Currently preparing for high-performance Software Engineering roles (2026).
